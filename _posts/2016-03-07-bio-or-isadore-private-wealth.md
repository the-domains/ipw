**Neil Witkowski is the founder and portfolio manager of Isadore Private Wealth, LLC. Neil has more than 15 years of experience serving individuals and businesses with their financial needs. Neil graduated with Honors from Central Michigan University with a dual major in Finance, majoring in Personal Financial Planning and Investments.**

**After honing his educational background in finance Neil started out at one of the largest brokerage firms in the country, Morgan Stanley. His experiences there were very helpful in forming his understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of being associated with an investment banking operation.**

**Three years later Neil started his own firm which quickly grew and eventually merged with a larger independent brokerage firm. It was in 2014 that Neil felt the timing was right to leave the brokerage world altogether and channel his experiences into an independent, fee-only wealth management firm focused on global value investing. That is when he started Isadore Private Wealth, LLC.**

**Creating Isadore has allowed Neil to invest for his clients in the most advantageous way he believes possible by offering independent, transparent advice with no commission bonus or hidden expenses involved. Isadore doesn't use managed accounts, mutual funds or other programs that put another layer of expenses or canned allocation models between him and the client which so often results in mediocrity. Looking the world over, through the lens of value investing practiced by Warren Buffett, Isadore designs globally diversified portfolios with the best ideas from individual stocks, currency, commodity and fixed income markets.**

**Neil is married to the love of his life and is blessed with five children. Neil is a member of Holy Rosary Parish.**
